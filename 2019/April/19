This day of 'Hanumad Jayanti' has been quite eventful. 

Started off with creation of website (mango mausam). 
Remembered insult from Rocky for visiting his house quite often. Fuck him dude. 

Hanumad Jayanti this time after yesterday's voting for lok sabha elections, also shares for Good Friday and another muslim celebration. 

Had a tough discussion with Dad. Well I proved his dramatic intent, and never-ending arguments. 
I have realized the drama of the cult. They are sucked into negativity & misery. 

I will work on myself, and my own self from here onwards. Fuck family, fuck the world, we only live for our-selves. 
God will take care of all of them he is responsible for. I will take care of myself, until the day I retire. 

Visited temple on the account of Hanumad Jayanti with mom. Enjoyed the time. Heard some of her grievances. 

Mancha baaradu, madadi baaralu, kanchu kannadi baarado, 
kartru yamanor, yeledu oyvaga, artha puthraru kayvare? 

Govinda Namo, Govinda Namo, Govinda Naarayana.
